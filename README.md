# CS391-20_21-Spring
This repository is the codebase for CS391 Web Development Class at Ozyegin University 2020 2021 Spring term

For this project Peker Celik, Yigit Demirsan, Betul Seyhan and Egemen Iscan worked as team member. 

In this project, we try to create a website which would let its users to browse through usernames which belong to some of the most well-known social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.After selecting a username and the social media, the website displays the users comments on the chosen username. For example if someone searches for the username @rickygervais on Twitter, which belongs to the famous English comedian Ricky Gervais, there may be some comments such as: "This user always tweets funny content." This may seem unnecessary when we apply this concept to very well-known people like Ricky Gervais, however, let's say that someone has followed our account and tries to communicate with us via Direct Message on Instagram. Their account is private which means that we can't see their content. In such case, we would use this website to understand who the account belongs to and if the account owner is a trustworthy person. This, of course, is not the sole purpose but only an example use case.

We haven't used any additional libaries since we implemented all necessary functionalities via javascript.

Here are the steps to use this website...
1) Start from the main_page.html. Go to About page and go back to "Home" after you have read the description.
2) Go to Register using the navigation tab on the right hand side of the page.
3) Fill each and every one of the blanks, your password should be more than 6 characters.
4) Do not forget this information.
5) Register and go to login page from the navigation bar.
6) Log in with your credentials.
7) On the navigation bar, you will see a "Comment" tab. Go to that tab and create some comments about random users from random social media accounts. Also, please create more than one comment on a single user.
8) Go back to main page.
9) Type one of the usernames in the searchbox you have commented about. If you want to filter the results, you can click on one of the buttons "Instagram, Youtube, Twitter" to only get the results concerning a single social media.
10) You can now display all the comments on that user.

Each member's responsibilities are distributed equally. Yigit Demirsan especially worked on the HTML part of the main_page and some parts of the CSS; for login_page some CSS parts and JS; for register_page some part of the HTML, JS and CSS parts. Betul Seyhan worked on especially register page HTML and some parts of CSS and JSS part; for login_page worked on some CSS, HTML and JS part; for comment page work on CSS.Peker Celik especially worked on comments JS and HTML also worked on login CSS, HTML and JS; for register_page JS parts. Egemen Iscan especially worked on the entire results page, the entire about page (HTML,CSS,JS included) and search bar on the main page and buttons color change. On the other hand we all have worked together to solve challenging  problems, share ideas, participate in pair programming and we made our best to assist each other whenever possible.

Now that we have explained the main goal of this project, let's take a look at the screenshots directly taken from the website. These screenshots serve as a user guide...
